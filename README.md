# swipejam
* Tinder for Spotify *

You only need to hear 30 seconds of a song to know if you've found your new jam. Swipejam helps you discover new music
by playing you 30 second previews of music recommended to you by Spotify's algorithm. You can swipe right if you like the
song, or left if you don't. Swiping right puts the song into a new playlist for you to listen to later. Every swipe
improves the algorithm so we can tailor the music to really suit you.
